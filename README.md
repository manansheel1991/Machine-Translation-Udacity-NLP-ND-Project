## Machine-Translation-Udacity-NLP-ND-Project

I completed this project in the NLP Nanodegree. In it, I trained different types of RNN models for performing Translation of English sentences to French.

## Different Types of Models used

1. A simple RNN Model
2. An RNN Model making use of an Embedding Layer
3. A bidirectional RNN Model
4. An Encoder-Decoder Type of Model
5. A custom model that makes use of the components present in all the above 4 models

## Files

The file 'machine_translation.ipynb' contains the complete project in detail

## Results

The custom model could reach an accuracy of 95% and it could correctly translate the two sample English sentences to French.
